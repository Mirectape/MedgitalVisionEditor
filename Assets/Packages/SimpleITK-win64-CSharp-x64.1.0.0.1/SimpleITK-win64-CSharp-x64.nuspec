    <description>SimpleITK is an image analysis toolkit with a large number of components supporting general filtering operations, image segmentation and registration. It is built on top of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit ITK with the intent of providing a simplified interface to ITK. SimpleITK itself is written in C++ but is available for a large number of programming languages. Currently these include: Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, TCL, Ruby. Wrapping of the C++ code is accomplished through SWIG, in principle, any language wrapped by SWIG should be applicable to SimpleITK. Unlike ITK's support of n-dimensional spatio-temporal images, SimpleITK supports 2D, 3D and optionally 3D+time. The dimensionality refers to spatio-temporal dimensions, the voxels can be n-dimensional vectors. SimpleITK is licensed under the Apache License in the same way as ITK.
